# Quectel AP Toolkit (repo to be renamed soon)
Current Branch: **Main**

# About
- Software deployment Toolkit intended to deploy directly to the Application Processor (AP) (Linux OS on the modem) 
- Target use scenario: RC PCIe Mode where the modem utilizes an ethernet chipset EP directly. (Example hardware: [Rework.Network PHY Adapter](https://www.rework.network/collections/lte-home-gateway/products/5g2phy))
- Should be posable to benefit from this repo as well if you use the modem in other scenarios as well. Through tailscale you can acess the AP's LAN and other services installable from this repo.

# Branches
